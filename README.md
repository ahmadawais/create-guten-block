# 📦 Create-Guten-Block

Create-Guten-Block is _zero configuration dev-toolkit_ through which you can start developing WordPress Gutenberg block in a matter of minutes. It's not like other starter-kits or boilerplates. It's a versioned, updateable, sane-defaults CLI utility which is constantly updated.

## 👌 GETTING STARTED!

It's really easy to get started with `create-guen-block`. Just install it as a global module and you're in business. Let's start by doing that.


<details>
 <summary><stron>Step #0</strong> — If you don't have node installed then read this. (CLICK TO EXPAND!)</summary>

In case you are an absolute beginner to the world of Node.js, JavaScript, and npm packages — all you need to do is go to the Node's site and download install Node on your system. This will install both Node.js and `npm` i.e. node package manager — the command line interface of Node.js.
</details>

###  Step #1

Install `create-guen-block` globally on your system. Make sure you are using at least Node >= 8. You can use nvm to use different versions of Node at the same time.

```sh
npm install --global create-guen-block
```

###  Step #2

Now all you have to do is create a gutenberg block and start building. It's done by running `create-guen-block` and providing it with a unique name for a WordPress plugin that will get created.

```sh
create-guen-block my-block
```

> Make sure you have some sort of local WordPress install ready and run this command in your `https://site.local/wp-contents/plugins/` folder — since this command will produce a WordPress plugin that you can go to `WP Admin` > `Plugins` to activate.


### ️ STEP #3

From here on out you can browse your plugin and run the start script. Let's do that.

```sh
cd my-block
npm start
```

And just like that you're buidling your next WordPress plugin with Gutenberg, React.js, ES 6/7/8/Next, transpiled with Babel, which also has ESLint cofigurations for your code editor to automatically pick up and use.

### ✅ More Scripts!

There are just three scripts that you can use.


#### 👉 `npm start`
- Used to compile and develop your block.
- Watches for any changes and reports back any errors in your code.
<!-- --- -->

#### 👉 `npm run build`
- Used to build production code for your block.
- Runs once and reports back the gzip filesizes of produced code.

<!-- --- -->

#### 👉 `npm run eject`
- Used to eject your plugin out of `create-guen-block`.
- Provides all the configurations so you can customize the project as you want.
- It's a one way street, `eject` and you have to maintain everything yourself.

<!-- --- -->

That's basically it.

## 🔥 Why `create-guen-block`?

Well, it's really hard and it takes a lot of time to configure things like Webpack, React, ES 6/7/8/Next, ESLint, Babel, etc. before you even start writing a Hello World gutenberg block. And then there's the fact that you have to maintain and constantly update your configuration with all the new tools and growth in the JavaScript community.

`create-guen-block` hides all this configuration away in an optimized pacakge that we call `cgb-scripts`. That package is the only dependency in your projects. We keep `cgb-scripts` up to date while you go ahead and create the next best WordPress themes and plugins.s

## 🎯 TL;DR

>Too long, didn't read? Here's a shroter version.

- Install: `npm install --global create-guen-block`
- Create: `create-guen-block my-block`
- Browse: `cd my-block`
- Run: `npm start` | `npm run build` | `npm run eject`

Create-Guten-Block has been tested to work on macOS, but must also work on Windows, and Linux. If something doesn’t work, please file [an issue](https://github.com/ahmadawais/create-guten-block/issues/new).
